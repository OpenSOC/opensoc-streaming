#OpenSOC-Indexing

##Module Description

This module provides the indexing capability to OpenSOC components.  The primary indexing engine for now is Elastic Search, but Solr may be supported at some point in the future as well.  There are three types of messages that are commonly indexed in OpenSOC topologies: messages, alerts, and errors.  Messages are telemetry messages parsed by the parser bolt.  Alerts are alerts generated by the alerts bolt.  Errors are an optional feature where each OpenSOC bolt in addition to outputting errors in the log file will also index them for immediate analysis.

###Index bolt

The signature of the index bolt is as follows:

```
TelemetryIndexingBolt indexing_bolt = new TelemetryIndexingBolt()
.withIndexIP(config.getString("es.ip"))
.withIndexPort(config.getInt("es.port"))
.withClusterName(config.getString("es.clustername"))
.withIndexName(
config.getString("bolt.error.indexing.indexname"))
.withDocumentName(
config.getString("bolt.error.indexing.documentname"))
.withBulk(config.getInt("bolt.error.indexing.bulk"))
.withIndexAdapter(adapter)
.withMetricConfiguration(config);

```

###IndexAdapters

*com.opensoc.indexing.adapters.ESBaseBulkAdapter - bulk ingest messages into Elastic Search
*com.opensoc.indexing.adapters.ESBaseBulkRotatingAdapter - does everything adapter above does, but is able to rotate the index names based on size
*com.opensoc.indexing.adapters.ESTimedBulkRotatingAdapter - does everything adapter above does, but is able to rotate the index names based on size and time
*com.opensoc.indexing.adapters.SolrAdapter - currently under development

/etc/ directory contains all environment-related configs

##Sample Input and Generator Spout

The sample input for topologies provided in this release was checked in here:

```
https://github.com/OpenSOC/opensoc-streaming/tree/master/OpenSOC-Topologies/src/main/resources/SampleInput
```

We provide a generator spout that is able to drive these topologies.  In production we run with the kafka spout, but for documentation on that please reference the Storm project documentation

The generator spout comes with the following signature:

```
GenericInternalTestSpout testSpout = new GenericInternalTestSpout()
.withFilename(test_file_path).withRepeating(
config.getBoolean("spout.test.parallelism.repeat"));
```

* the repeat variable defines if the generator spout will loop through the input or stop once it gets to the end of file

###Additional Storm Bolts
In addition to custom bolts developed for OpenSOC we utilize standard bolts and spouts included with the Storm release.  We will not provide documentation for these spouts and bolts since they are provided as part of Storm.  These spouts bolts are:

* KafkaSpout
* KafkaBolt
* HDFSBolt
* HBaseBolt
